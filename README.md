- 👋 Hi, I’m @datathehustlercowpie
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics, data visualization, and AI. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and PostgreSQL.
- 💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on mental health and linguistics projects.  
- 📫 You can reach me at christinamberdavis@gmail.com. 

-Please note that the majority of my projects at the moment are learning exercises. In time, I hope to add some more projects that are less about learning
-basic skills, and more about the things I find most interesting.
